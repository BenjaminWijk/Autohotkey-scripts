# Autohotkey-scripts
Just some tiny (and probably hacky) AHK-scripts. Each script filename should somewhat convey its intention.

I use most of these as pain relief, since I play way too many games, and some games have repetitive behaviors that doesn't "allow" your hands/fingers to rest.
So being able to either skip holding a completely (autorun), or moving a normally non-rebindable game command to the other hand is great.
For example:
- Diablo 2 does not let you rebind the move-command, and like 90% of all actions you do in the game are done with the mouse. Being able to bind left-click so that you can perform it with your other hand is great, as the mouse-hand simply relax and position the cursor, while the other hand does the clicking.
-  Kingdoms of Amalur is a MMO-ish type game where you run around a lot. This is done by holding W. But you mostly alter direction with mouse, so your left hand can be incredibly static for long periods of time. A simple autorun feature pretty much avoids this issue.
