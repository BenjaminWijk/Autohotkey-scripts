# Autohotkey-scripts
Just some tiny (and probably hacky) AHK-scripts. Each script filename should somewhat convey its intention.

I use most of these as pain relief (continously holding a key for a long period of time strains my wrist).
So being able to either skip holding it completely (autorun), or moving a non-rebindable game command to the other hand is great.
For example:
- Diablo 2 does not let you rebind the move-command, and like 90% of all actions you do in the game are done with the mouse. Being able to bind left-click so that you can perform it with your other hand is great, and allows your hand to rest.
- kb + mouse games where you forward a lot (holding W, but you mostly alter direction with mouse) dsoesn't let your left hand rest. Most games where this comes up has an autorun feature, but not all (looking at you, Kingdoms of Amalur)
